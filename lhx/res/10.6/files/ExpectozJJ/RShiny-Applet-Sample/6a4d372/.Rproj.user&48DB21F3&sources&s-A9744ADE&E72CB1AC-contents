## Introduction to WAZA 
<div class="columns-2">
```{r out.width = "100%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("waza.png", dpi=800)
```

WAZA originates from its meaning in japanese whereby it represents action/movement with a certain form. 

In WAZA, our product consists of:

- WAZA Gloves

- WAZA Application
</div>

## WAZA Gloves
<div class="columns-2">
<div class="centered">
```{r out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("Glove_1.jpg", dpi=800)
```
</div>
### Material
Our WAZA Gloves are made with the ALLsense fabric which contains high-quality fabric with embedded textile circuitry to incorporate microcontroller (E.g. Arduino) to monitor movements from user. The microcontroller can be connected to the WAZA Application via Bluetooth.
</div>

## WAZA Gloves
### Sensors 
Our WAZA Gloves currently has 3 main sensors: Accelerometer, Proximity sensor and the Touch sensor. 
<div class="centered">
```{r out.width = "70%"}
include_graphics("Sketch.png", dpi=800)
```
</div>


## WAZA Application 
<div class="columns-2">
<div class="centered">
```{r out.width = "50%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("wazaapp1.png", dpi=800)
```
</div>
<div class="centered">
```{r out.width = "40%"}
include_graphics("waza3.png", dpi=800)
```
</div>
The WAZA application allows the user to log in to their WAZA accounts to view their training and competition records. 

## WAZA Application 
<div class="columns-2">
<div class="centered">
```{r out.width = "50%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("wazaapp2.png", dpi=800)
```
</div>
Users can select the following modes:

- Training
- Competition 

</div>

## WAZA Application: Training Mode
<div class="columns-2">
<div class="centered">
```{r out.width = "60%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("wazaapp3.png", dpi=800)
```
</div>
Users can select the components they want to track.
Selected components will be highlighted. Once START is pressed, the tracking begins.
</div>

## WAZA Application: Accelerometer Data
<div class="centered">
```{r , include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
eval(parse('plot.r'))
```
```{r out.width = "100%"}
p
```
</div>
Accelerometer Data that can be extracted from WAZA Gloves to WAZA App.

## WAZA Application: Gesture Recognition
By using sensors and IoT, we can use Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm to perform gesture recognition in WAZA App to identify the different sparring movements for the WAZA Gloves.

<div class="columns-2">
```{r , include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
eval(parse('plot3.r'))
```
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.height=3.5}
p
```
```{r , include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
eval(parse('plot2.r'))
```
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.height=3.5}
p
```
</div>
## WAZA Application: Proximity Data
Proximity data is collected from the sensors and recorded in the WAZA App.
```{r, context="server"}
library(shiny)
source('app.R')
app
```
