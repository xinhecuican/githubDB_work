JSON Configuration Format
=========================

JSON_ is a self-contained, human-readable data-interchange format. It is pure
text and language independent. The main structures are key/value pairs
(hash-tables, dictionaries, associative arrays ...) and ordered lists (arrays,
vectors, sequences ...). For a complete description you may refer to the complete
reference at json.org.
