## What is the UFO framework?

UFO is a multi-threaded, GPU-enabled and distributed data processing
*framework*. It provides base classes, scheduler implementations and run-time
management to describe a workflow as a graph of processing nodes. The nodes are
implemented as [plugins](https://github.com/ufo-kit/ufo-filters) in the
ufo-filters sister project.
